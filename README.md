# Airline Crew Scheduling

This project implements a simple backtracking-based solution for assigning flights to crew members. The algorithm ensures that flights do not overlap and that a minimum rest time is maintained between assignments.

## Contents
- Backtracking scheduler
- Constraint checking for overlaps and rest time
- Optional cost-based assignment
- Time and memory profiling
- Basic Gantt chart visualization
